## DATA QUESTION
The Australian Mining Industry to making changes towards cleaner commodities and gender equality.

## Visualisation 1: AVERAGE OVERALL EMPLOYMENT COUNTS BY SEX
The trends of Full Time and Part Time Employment in the Australian Mining Industry for each year broken down by Sex. The view is filtered on Year and Sex. The Year filter ranges from 2002 to 2020. The Sex filter keeps Females and Males.

## Visualisation 2: EMPLOYMENT COUNTS PER SEX BY STATE
Full time and part time employment are broken down by sex. The year ranges from 2002 - 2020 by default but can be narrowed down for deeper insights on trend. Numbers at the end of the graph show beggining and ending employment counts, creating a "then and now" affect. Hover your cursor over data points for more information.

## Visualisation 3: STOCK VALUE PER COMMODITY BY YEAR
Although Natural Gas is a fossil fuel, it has much fewer global warming emissions from its combustion in comparison to Black Coal, Brown Coal and Crude Oil. Natural Gas is readily available, easy to store and emits about half the carbon of coal when used to generate electricity. Gas is safer to heat than Oil and more environmentally friendly, with Natural Gas sending out 25% less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Natural Gas is proved to be a better alternative to nuclear power, giving it favourability over Uranium. LPG is the next closest contender to Natural Gas, looking from an environmentally friendly aspect. LPG is not a natural gas but is derived from the natural gas process. LPG is more expensive than Natural Gas. Natural Gas also produces slighlty less carbon dioxide when burned and is a lighter gas, meaning it'll dissipate faster if there is a leak.

## Visualisation 4: Are Australian households using renewable energy?
(Using machine learning)
Renewable energy extracted by households is plotted against years. A linear trend is observed after 2009. This means there is an increase in use of renewable energy for Australian house holds and the work of the mining industry is paying off
